#### This is my portfolio website built entirely using HTML5 and CSS Flexbox. Content includes links to my published works, how to contact me and my social media handles. 


#### The site was built using Flexbox. The body is contained within the main wrapper container that lays out 4 items in 'flex-direction: column'. These items corresponds to different sections of the page - Header, Hero, About Me, Work and Contact Me. These items are also nested flex containers that container their children items.
